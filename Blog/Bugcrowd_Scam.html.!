    <h1>⚠️ Bugcrowd Bug Bounty Program: A Platform Losing Integrity?</h1>
    <p>
      Over the past 2–3 years, I have been actively participating in bug bounty programs hosted on <strong>Bugcrowd</strong>. While it was once promising, my experience has slowly raised serious doubts about its transparency, fairness, and overall integrity—especially for individual security researchers.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Why This Blog?</h2>
    <p>
      I want to share my personal experience, particularly with the <strong>“Stability AI US Services Vulnerability Disclosure Engagement”</strong> program, which recently highlighted systemic problems with how reports are evaluated and credited.
    </p>

    <h2>🧵 How My Trust Was Broken</h2>
    <p>
      Despite years of effort, almost all my submissions were marked as <strong>duplicates</strong>. I remained optimistic until the Stability AI program was launched on <strong>13 May 2025</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I participated early—only 7 public reports were visible: 5 server misconfigurations and 2 data exposure.</li>
      <li>I submitted the first report on <strong>05 June 2025</strong>: <em>“JWT Reuse Leads to Critical Security Issue”</em> and <em>“JWT Valid After Account Deletion”</em>.</li>
      <li>My report was marked as <strong>Informational</strong> citing “acceptable risk” by the customer—even though the issue was critical.</li>
      <li>I followed up with a detailed explanation—no response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚨 Then, Something Odd Happened</h2>
    <p>
      Frustrated by the lack of response, I submitted a new report on <strong>17 June 2025</strong>: <em>“Failure to Invalidate Active Session Upon Password Reset”</em>. This was submitted under their main domain, and a similar issue was found on another subdomain.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Bugcrowd Response:</strong><br>
      “Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, we have received this report from another researcher. Therefore, it is considered a duplicate issue...”
    </div>

    <p>
      This raised suspicions. Why? Because before my report, their public report list did not include any mention of <strong>"Broken Authentication and Session Management"</strong>. Only after I submitted, the category appeared—yet my submission was called a duplicate.
    </p>

    <h2>📉 Pattern of Dismissal</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My effort and time (more than 2 days testing) was wasted.</li>
      <li>Bugcrowd provided no transparent proof that someone else had submitted the same.</li>
      <li>I submitted issues across multiple domains—yet still got a <strong>duplicate</strong> tag.</li>
      <li>Even when following their own <strong>Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy</strong>, my reports were sidelined.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔍 Is Bugcrowd Losing Its Credibility?</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t just about one report—it reflects a pattern many researchers have seen:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delayed or no response to impact clarifications.</li>
      <li>Customer bias in accepting/rejecting vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Dubious duplication decisions without visibility or timeline proof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💬 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      After years of engagement, I am stepping away from Bugcrowd. The effort, time, and expertise we invest deserves respect, transparency, and fair evaluation—not dismissal and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is not meant to discredit the idea of bug bounty programs, but to call attention to the internal flaws that discourage genuine researchers. I hope this experience helps others decide where to focus their efforts.
