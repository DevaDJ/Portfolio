    <h1>‚ö†Ô∏è Citizen Service Portal & Bribery Concerns: A Reality Check</h1>

    </div>

    <p>
      Government portals promise speed and transparency. My last six months tell a different story: a critical login flow that blocks citizens, unanswered escalations, and an on‚Äëground process that ended with an outright bribe demand. This post documents everything I experienced so other citizens know what to expect‚Äîand what to record.
    </p>

    <h2>üéØ Why I‚Äôm Writing This</h2>
    <p>
      On <strong>02 February 2025</strong>, I discovered a blocking issue on the Citizen Service Portal. During mobile number verification, the <strong>username field was not enterable</strong>, making account creation/verification impossible. I reported it immediately and kept following up. As of <strong>22 August 2025</strong>, the bug still persists from my vantage point. This shows not just a technical problem, but how governance systems neglect citizen experience.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>The Bug in One Line:</strong> <em>Mobile verification step prevents entering the username; flow cannot be completed.<br> <b> URL: https://tamilnilam.tn.gov.in/citizen/updateProfile.html</b></em>
    </div>

    <h2>üì¨ What I Tried (And What Happened)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>E‚Äëmailed the portal‚Äôs listed contact addresses ‚Üí <strong>No actionable response</strong>.</li>
      <li>Called the phone number listed on the same page ‚Üí <strong>Number was incorrect</strong>.</li>
      <li>Raised the issue with the <strong>TN CM Helpline</strong> multiple times ‚Üí initial calls were <strong>cut</strong>, later I was told, ‚Äú<em>Necessary action will be taken</em>.‚Äù</li>
      <li>Followed up again the next week ‚Üí <strong>same response</strong>, no fix.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These failures left me with no alternative but to go through physical offices and middlemen for services that should have been simple online. This is where the larger issue starts.
    </p>

    <h2>üß≠ When I Needed a Patta Transfer</h2>
    <p>
      A few months later, I had to apply for a <strong>patta transfer</strong>. I visited our <strong>VAO office</strong> to confirm the exact land sub‚Äëdivision. Despite being polite, I was not heard and got no guidance. With the portal still broken, I used a <strong>CSC center</strong> to file the application and paid the official fee. A government service designed for self‚Äëreliance turned into dependency on third‚Äëparty centers.
    </p>

    <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Site Visit & The Bribe Demand</h2>
    <p>
      The surveyor scheduled a visit, inspected the land, and while returning was accompanied by a few other people. In front of the official's, I was asked to pay a <strong>bribe 9‚Äì10√ó the official fee</strong>, allegedly ‚Äúfor higher officers.‚Äù This was not implied‚Äîit was explicit. Officials bringing outsiders during official duty raises strong suspicion that bribery is institutionalized.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight warning">
      <strong>Why this feels systemic:</strong> A broken portal funnels citizens to intermediaries, while on‚Äëground teams normalize ‚Äúextra‚Äù payments. When technology fails and accountability is vague, corruption thrives.
    </div>

    <h2>‚ùì What I Expect from Authorities</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>1) Fix the Portal</h3>
        <p>Resolve the mobile verification username bug; publish a changelog and announce the fix. Maintain clear service‚Äëstatus dashboards.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>2) Correct Contacts</h3>
        <p>Ensure phone numbers and e‚Äëmails on government portals are accurate and staffed; audit them quarterly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>3) SLA & Tracking</h3>
        <p>Give citizens a ticket ID, SLA, and escalation path. Share anonymized resolution metrics every month.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>4) Zero‚ÄëTolerance</h3>
        <p>Prohibit non‚Äëofficial persons from accompanying survey teams. Enable anonymous sting/whistleblower reporting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>5) Awareness Programs</h3>
        <p>Create simple public resources listing official fees, processes, and citizen rights. When people know the rules, they can resist corruption.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>üß∞ Tips for Fellow Citizens</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Record dates, names, and call IDs. Keep e‚Äëmail headers and acknowledgments.</li>
      <li>When possible, video/audio record interactions per local law; redact private data before sharing.</li>
      <li>Pay only via official channels and collect receipts. Avoid cash to intermediaries.</li>
      <li>Escalate in writing; ask explicitly for a written decision and turnaround time.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>My position:</strong> I followed the rules, paid official fees, and still met a wall of silence and a blatant bribe demand. This is not a one‚Äëoff glitch‚Äîit is a governance gap.
    </div>

    <div class="cta-banner">
      <h3>üö® Call to Action</h3>
      <p>
        I request the <strong>TN Revenue Head management</strong> and <strong>Ministers</strong> to conduct <strong>awareness campaigns</strong>, publish <strong>clear fee guidelines</strong>, and provide <strong>public courses</strong> on citizen rights. This won‚Äôt cost much but will empower the below‚Äëmiddle‚Äëclass citizens like us to resist corruption.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hoping for good politicians forward to 2026.</strong></p>
